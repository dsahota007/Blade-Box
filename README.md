# BladeBox
 
In this fast-paced arcade game, you control a box armed with blades on each side. 
Your goal is to slice through enemy crates using your blades while avoiding direct crate-to-crate collisions. 
Precision and timing are key â€” only your blades can destroy the other crates! Stay sharp and see how long you can survive the chaos.
